# Jungle Devs - Node Challenge #001 ðŸ‘‹

## Description

This API is a simplified version of news provider API.

**Challenge goal**: The purpose of this challenge is to give my overall understanding of a backend application. Some of the concepts applied are:

- REST architecture;
- Authentication and permissions;
- Data modeling and migrations;
- SQL database;
- Query optimization;
- Serialization;
- Production builds.

## First steps

1. You'll need Node.JS and PostgreSQL 10
2. Install dependences with `npm install`
3. Set environment variables creating a copy of `.env.example` in `.env`
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start PostgreSQL DB
5. Run `npm run migration:run` to execute last version migration on database
6. Run project with `npm run dev`

## Instructions to create production build

1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Run `npm run prod` to run production build


**Final accomplishment**: By the end of this challenge youâ€™ll have a production ready API.
